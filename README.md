- Notes and pointers for the [NPTEL Course by Abhiram Ranade](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/101/106101208/)
- This repository will be in accordance with the run of [January 2022 - April 2022](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc22_cs42/preview)

## Week 1

### Lecture 1: Introduction

- Computers are everywhere!
- Computer is defined as a giant electrical circuit that can receive data from external world, perform the calculations and send data to external world.
- Calculations depend on the program
- Program: a precise description of calculations we want the computer to perform
- `C++`: Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, evolved out of C programming language
- Programming environment provided by [SimpleCPP](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ranade/simplecpp/) developed by IITB for beginners to programming
- The recommended textbook is written by the author of the course, [Dr. Abhiram Ranade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ranade/book.html)
- Introduction to C++ programs using SimpleCPP: **Turtle Simulator** inspired by the **Logo** software created by Seymour Pappert et al. to introduce children to programming.
