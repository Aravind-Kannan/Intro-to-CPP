1. Try putting the bits/ folder in this location:
    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/

2. Create stdc++.h inside the newly created bits/ folder:
    https://github.com/tekfyl/bits-stdc-.h-for-mac/blob/master/stdc%2B%2B.h

But the above method doesn't resolve other errors!

Alternative solution:

brew install gcc
Use     : gcc-[version_number] [target_file] (or) g++-[version_number] [target_file]
Example : gcc-11 a.cpp (or) g++-11 a.cpp
